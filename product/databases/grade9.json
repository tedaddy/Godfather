    "task1" : "Do you know why it is hot in the summer and cold in the winter? Most people believe that it is because the Earth is closer to the Sun in the summer and farther from it in the winter. But it is not like this at al! Infact, the distance between the Eath and the Suns largest in July and smalest in January!Scientists suggest that the reason for different summer and winter temperatures is the angle of the Sun's rays. In the summer, the rays rach the Earth almost at right angle. Due to this, the rays are not spread out and a smaller area of the planet's surface gets the energy. In the winter, the angle changes and the Sun's rays are spread out over a larger area. Besides this, the long nights and short days do not give enough time for the land to warm up.\n",
